# Contributing

The issue tracker is only for bug reports and enhancement suggestions. If you have a question, 
please ask it in the [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/E7KAuWG) instead of opening an issue â€“ you will get redirected there anyway.

If you wish to contribute to the SBLF-Advertising codebase or documentation, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request. 
We use ESLint to enforce a consistent coding style, so having that set up in you editor of choice is a great boon to your development process.

# Setup

1. Fork & clone the repository, and make sure you're on the master branch
2. Run `npm install` & `install dev dependencies`
4. Rename `.env.exampal` to `.env` and fill in the info
4. Code Away to your heart's content!
5. Run `npm test` to run ESLint and ensure any JSDoc changes are valid
6. Submit a pull request (Make sure you follow the conventional commit format)
